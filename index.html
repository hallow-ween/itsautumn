<h2> It is called <b>autumn </b></h2>
<p> it is not "fall", it is autumn. </p>
<p> The word <i>autumn</i> derives from the Latin word <i>autumnus</i>, which means 'the passing of the year'. <br> the word appeared in the late 1300s as an adaptation of the old french word <i>autumpne</i>. <br> The more common (and inferior) term <i>fall</i> was coined nearly three centuries later. <br> The word autumn was interconnected with harvest, so other than being the original word, it also is associated with the cozy season we love! </p>
