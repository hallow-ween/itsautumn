<p> The word <i id="autumnWord">autumn</i> derives from the Latin word <i id="autumnWord">autumnus</i>, which means 'the passing of the year'. <br> the word appeared in the late 1300s as an adaptation of the old french word <i id="autumnWord">autumpne</i>. <br> The more common (and inferior) term <i>fall</i> was coined nearly three centuries later. <br> The word autumn was interconnected with harvest, so other than being the original word, it also is associated with the cozy season we love!<br> The <b>Autumnal Equinox</b> falls on September 22nd (Northen Hemesphere) and marks the start of <b>autumn</b>. You can use the button down below to check if it is <b>autumn</b> or not.</p>
